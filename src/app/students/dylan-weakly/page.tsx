          I am a sophomore at the University of Northwestern - St. Paul,
          majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity. I am
          passionate about leveraging the skills God has given me to create
          thoughtful, efficient software solutions. My programming experience
          spans multiple languages and frameworks, including Python, TypeScript,
          C++, Java, and Reactâ€”the latter of which I used to help develop this
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since April 2025, I have also served as a Technical Support Specialist
          in the university&apos;s Information Technology department. This role
          has allowed me to further strengthen my problem-solving and critical
          thinking abilities by assisting users with a wide range of technical
          issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of my interests outside of Computer Science include going hiking
          with my family at state parks, attending car shows, and serving on the
          production team at church.
