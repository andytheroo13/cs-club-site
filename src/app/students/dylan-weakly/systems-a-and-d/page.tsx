          In Fall 2024, I collaborated with Northwestern alumnus Isaac Grosser
          to identify and address a business inefficiency at Atkinson
          Refinishing Services. Through a comprehensive analysis of their
          operations, we discovered that the company was still relying on
          paper-based processes to manage invoicesâ€”an approach that hindered
          efficiency and scalability. Initially, our team proposed the
          development of a custom invoicing platform tailored to the
          company&apos;s specific needs. However, due to time constraints, we
          pivoted toward identifying and evaluating existing electronic
          invoicing solutions that could offer immediate value and mobile
          compatibility.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-10 text-xl">
          Our research led us to two viable mobile invoicing platforms:
          QuickBooks and Square. We delivered a detailed report to Atkinson
          Refinishing Services outlining the features, advantages, and
          implementation considerations of each solution. These recommendations
          aimed to enhance the company&apos;s operational efficiency and
          organization by transitioning from a manual invoicing process to a
          modern, digital system.
